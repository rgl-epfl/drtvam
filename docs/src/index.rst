Dr.TVAM
=======

`Dr.TVAM <https://github.com/rgl-epfl/drtvam>`_ is an inverse rendering framework for tomographic additive
manufacturing. It provides a set of tools to model a TVAM printing process and
optimize projection patterns for it. It is implemented in Python on top of the
`Mitsuba 3 <https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba3>`_ framework.

It is possible to use Dr.TVAM to setup a wide variety of experiments. In
particular, we support:

* Printing in scattering media. 
* Printing with arbitrary container geometry (round, square, ...), or
  occluding objects (e.g. overprinting), with correct handling of the light
  transport. 
* Printing with a variety of projection models, and an arbitrary
  container motion. 
* Optimizing patterns for TVAM with our surface-aware
  discretization.

Installation
------------

We recommend installing Dr.TVAM directly with ``pip``:


.. code-block:: bash

    pip install drtvam

Or the current development version with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install https://github.com/rgl-epfl/drtvam

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install it manually:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:rgl-epfl/drtvam.git
    pip install ./drtvam

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``Python >= 3.8``
- A NVIDIA GPU with driver version ``>= 495.89``
- Alternatively, to use Dr.TVAM on the CPU: ``LLVM >= 11.1``. The performance
  will be significantly lower than on the GPU, however.

Getting started
---------------

Dr.TVAM is a python-based framework that allows great flexibility in setting up
an inverse optimization for TVAM. We also provide a command-line tool to run an
optimization from a configuration file. We detail the how to use it in the
:ref:`basic_usage` section.

For more advanced usage of Dr.TVAM, it is possible to implement one's own
optimization pipeline. We provide a set of tutorials to explain the key concepts
in the :ref:`tutorials` section.
